wordpress-rss-super-feed
========================

This XSLT file dynamically transforms a wordpress RSS feed. Limits entry outputs by total number of characters and tries to end on whitespace where possible. Converts the cdata back to HTML. Photos in the wordpress blog must be surrounded my anchor tags. Requires and additional external js file dues to limits on the use of specual characters in XSLT.
